# 🚦 Right before Left (Priority) and more driving Simulator

A high-performance,
2D traffic intersection simulator built with **Rust**,
compiled to **WebAssembly (WASM)**,
and rendered using **Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)**. 

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Logic Engine:** [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (High-performance, memory-safe traffic calculations).
* **Runtime:** [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (Near-native execution in the browser).
* **Renderer:** **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)** (Resolution-independent, DOM-accessible 2D graphics).
* **Animation:** [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) (Optional motion path handling).
* **Bridge:** `wasm-bindgen` & `web-sys` (Direct Rust-to-DOM manipulation).

## 🚀 Key Features

-   **Deterministic Traffic Logic:** Implements the "Right before Left" priority rule using a spatial coordinate system.
-   **Vector Precision:** Crisp rendering at any zoom level, perfect for observing tight intersection maneuvers.
-   **Zero-Dependency UI:** The game "world" is part of the DOM, allowing for easy debugging via Browser Inspector.
-   **High Performance:** Capable of simulating 100+ vehicles with complex yielding logic without frame drops.

## ⚖️ The Simulation Rules

The "Right before Left" (Priority to the Right) rule is the core of this project. The simulation follows these logical steps:

1.  **Detection:** As a vehicle approaches an unregulated intersection, it enters a "Scan Zone."
2.  **Validation:** The Rust engine checks the lane immediately to the vehicle's right.
3.  **Yielding:** If a vehicle is present in the right-hand lane within a specific distance threshold ($d < threshold$), the current vehicle's velocity is set to $0$.
4.  **Resolution:** Once the right-hand lane is clear, the vehicle resumes its target speed.
